*This file covers notes about ethernet/linux on the zynq platform/our board*

----------------Linux on ZedBoard-------------------------------------------------------
	-Installing is pretty straightforward. Simply installing petalinux and using their default bsp gets linux up and running pretty quickly. Instructions for getting started via this method is available at: http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/PetaLinux+Getting+Started
	
	-To get ethernet between two ZedBoards working, the easiest thing to do is to simply modify the /etc/network/interfaces file to assign a static ip to each ZedBoard. The below commands will do this in petalinux, with a different ip substituted for each board and the below files added to the empty settings app (source https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Embedded-Linux/setting-static-ip-in-petalinux-zedboard/td-p/424124)
		petalinux-create -t apps -n settings --enable
		petalinux-config -c rootfs
		petalinux-build

--makefile
ifndef PETALINUX
$(error "Error: PETALINUX environment variable not set.  Change to the root of your PetaLinux install, and source the settings.sh file")
endif

include apps.common.mk

APP = settings

all: build install

.PHONY: build
build:

install:
	# Copy settings files to the rootfs.
	cp interfaces $(TARGETDIR)/etc/network/interfaces
	cp resolve.conf $(TARGETDIR)/etc/resolv.conf

clean:
--end makefile


--interface
# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)
 
# The loopback interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# Wired or wireless interfaces
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.111
	netmask 255.25.255.0
	network 192.168.1.0
	gateway 192.168.1.9

----------------linux on Custom Board-------------------------------------------------------
	-easiest path for installation on this board is to follow Brandon's wiki to compile and install ubuntu 14.04 from a linux host machine. His wiki and source code can be found on bitbucket. For access, contact him at bmperez@andrew.cmu.edu or me at ajfoster@andrew.cmu.edu.

	-Ethernet between two boards does not unfortunately work, as there is currently a bug in the autonegatiation of the gigabit link. As such, the connection fails. Putting a switch in between two boards allows them to connect rather seemlessly, albeit only at 100mbps. Assigning a static ip in the interfaces file or setting it to DHCP is recommended here. 



-----------------Notes about ethernet connectivity---------------------------------------
-Gigabit transfer between two zedboards: no problem with this so long as they are assigned ips. Actual Tansfer speed is around 660 mbps

- Gigabit transfer between computer and zed board: no problem here and same results as above.

- Gigabit transfer between computer and Enclustra starter board : negotiates successfully to gigabit ethernet connection, but actual speed not tested

- Gigabit transfer between Enclustra starter board and our baseboard : not tested

- Gigabit transfer between computer and our baseboard : no luck here. Autonegotiation fails and the computer only sees the board as supporting 100mbps, which is achieved in practice

- Gigabit transfer between two of our baseboards : no luck here either. They fail to recognize anything as plugged into the port when they are directly connected. When a switch is used, the result is the same as between computer and our board.
